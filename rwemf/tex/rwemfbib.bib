	abstract = {Collaborative Filtering ({CF}) is widely employed for making Web service recommendation. {CF}-based Web service recommendation aims to predict missing {QoS} (Quality-of-Service) values of Web services. Although several {CF}-based Web service {QoS} prediction methods have been proposed in recent years, the performance still needs significant improvement. First, existing {QoS} prediction methods seldom consider personalized influence of users and services when measuring the similarity between users and between services. Second, Web service {QoS} factors, such as response time and throughput, usually depends on the locations of Web services and users. However, existing Web service {QoS} prediction methods seldom took this observation into consideration. In this paper, we propose a location-aware personalized {CF} method for Web service recommendation. The proposed method leverages both locations of users and Web services when selecting similar neighbors for the target user or service. The method also includes an enhanced similarity measurement for users and Web services, by taking into account the personalized influence of them. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using a real-world Web service dataset. The experimental results indicate that our approach improves the {QoS} prediction accuracy and computational efficiency significantly, compared to previous {CF}-based methods.},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems ({CPS}) have received much attention from both academia and industry. An increasing number of functions in {CPS} are provided in the way of services, which gives rise to an urgent task, that is, how to recommend the suitable services in a huge number of available services in {CPS}. In traditional service recommendation, collaborative filtering ({CF}) has been studied in academia, and used in industry. However, there exist several defects that limit the application of {CF}-based methods in {CPS}. One is that under the case of high data sparsity, {CF}-based methods are likely to generate inaccurate prediction results. In this paper, we discover that mining the potential similarity relations among users or services in {CPS} is really helpful to improve the prediction accuracy. Besides, most of traditional {CF}-based methods are only capable of using the service invocation records, but ignore the context information, such as network location, which is a typical context in {CPS}. In this paper, we propose a novel service recommendation method for {CPS}, which utilizes network location as context information and contains three prediction models using random walking. We conduct sufficient experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and verify that the network location is indeed useful in {QoS} prediction.},

	abstract = {Recommending the suitable Web service is an important topic in today's society. The critical step is to accurately predict {QoS} of Web services. However, the highly sparse {QoS} data complicate the challenges. In the real world, since {QoS} delivery can be significantly affected by some dominant factors in the service environment (e.g., network delay and the location of user or service), Web services which are published by the same provider usually have the similar fundamental network environment. These factors can be leveraged for accurate {QoS} predictions, leading to high-quality service recommendations. In this paper, we expound how Latent Factor Models ({LFM}) can be utilized to predict the unknown {QoS} values. Meanwhile, we take the factors of provider and its country into consideration, which imply the latent physical location and network status information, as the latent neighbor for the set of Web services. Hence, the novel neighbor factor model is built to evaluate the personalized connection quality of latent neighbors for each service user. Then, we propose an integrated model based on {LFM}. Finally, we conduct a group of experiments on a large-scale real-world {QoS} dataset and the results demonstrate that our approach is effective, especially in the situation of data sparsity.},

	abstract = {Fast deployment of mobile Internet makes Web services often consumed under a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal model, wherein a specific service client could keep active while its location is changing. Recommending Web services for such clients must be able to predict unknown {QoS} values with the target client's service requesting time and location taken into account, e.g., Performing the prediction via a set of measured multi-dimensional {QoS} data. Most {QoS} prediction methods focus on the {QoS} characteristics for one specific dimension, e.g., Time or location, and do not exploit the structural relationships among the multi-dimensional {QoS} data. This paper proposes an integrated {QoS} prediction approach which unifies the modeling of multi-dimensional {QoS} data via multi-linear-algebra based concepts of tensor and enables efficient service recommendation for Web service based mobile clients via tensor decomposition and reconstruction optimization algorithms. Comparative experimental evaluation results show that the proposed {QoS} prediction approach could result in much better accuracy in recommending Web services than several other representative ones.},

	abstract = {Between matrix factorization or Random Walk with Restart ({RWR}), which method works better for recommender systems? Which method handles explicit or implicit feedback data better? Does additional side information help recommen- dation? Recommender systems play an important role in many e-commerce services such as Amazon and Netflix to recommend new items to a user. Among various recommendation strategies, collaborative filtering has shown good performance by using rating patterns of users. Matrix factorization and random walk with restart are the most representative collaborative filtering methods. However, it is still unclear which method provides better recommendation performance despite their extensive utility. In this paper, we provide a comparative study of matrix factorization and {RWR} in recommender systems. We exactly formulate each correspondence of the two methods according to various tasks in recommendation. Especially, we newly devise an {RWR} method using global bias term which corresponds to a matrix factorization method using biases. We describe details of the two methods in various aspects of recommendation quality such as how those methods handle cold-start problem which typ- ically happens in collaborative filtering. We extensively perform experiments over real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of each method in terms of various measures. We observe that matrix factorization performs better with explicit feedback ratings while {RWR} is better with implicit ones. We also observe that exploiting global popularities of items is advantageous in the performance and that side information produces positive synergy with explicit feedback but gives negative effects with implicit one.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Stochastic optimization algorithms have many desirable features for large-scale machine learning, and accordingly have been the focus of renewed and intensive study in the last several years (e.g., see the papers [2], [5], [14] and references therein). The empirical efficiency of these methods is backed with strong theoretical guarantees, providing sharp bounds on their convergence rates. These convergence rates are known to depend on the structure of the underlying objective function, with faster rates being possible for objective functions that are smooth and/or (strongly) convex, or optima that have desirable features such as sparsity. More precisely, for an objective function that is strongly convex, stochastic gradient descent enjoys a convergence rate ranging from O(1/T ), when features vectors are extremely sparse, to O(d/T ) when feature vectors are dense [10], [6]. A complementary type of condition is that of sparsity, either exact or approximate, in the optimal solution. Sparse models have proven useful in many application areas (see the overview papers [4], [9], [3] and references therein for further background), and many optimization-based statistical procedures seek to exploit such sparsity via ℓ1-regularization. A significant feature of optimization algorithms for sparse problems is their mild logarithmic scaling with the problem dimension [11], [12], [5], [14]. More precisely, itis known [11], [12] that when the optimal solution θ has at most s non-zero entries, appropriate versions of the stochastic mirror descent algorithm ',/ converge at a rate O(s (log d)/T ). Srebro et al. [13] exploit the smoothness of many common loss functions; in application to sparse linear regression, their analysis yields improved rates ',/ of the form O(η (s log d)/T), where η is the noise variance. While the Vlog d scaling of the dimension makes these methods attractive in high dimensions, the scaling with respe- t to the number V of iterations is relatively slow-namely, O(1/ T ) versus O(1/T) for strongly convex problems.The algorithm proposed in this paper aims to use both strong convexity and sparsity. We show that the algorithm has convergence rate O((s log d)/T) for a strongly convex problem with an s-sparse optimum in d dimensions. Moreover, this rate is unimprovable up to constant factors, meaning that no algorithm can converge at a substantially faster rate. The method builds off recent work on multi-step methods for strongly convex problems [7], [8], but involves some new ingredients that are essential to obtain optimal rates for statistical problems with sparse optima. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the convergence rate of the algorithm, and demonstrate its performance in comparison to other methods: regularized dual averaging [14] and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. We refer the reader to the full report [1] for more details.},

Therefore, how to mine matching patterns between services in relevant domains and compositions becomes crucial to service recommendation for composition. Existing methods usually overlook domain relevance and domain-specific matching patterns, which restrict the quality of recommendations. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to offer domain-aware service recommendation. First, a K Nearest Neighbor variant ({vKNN}) based on topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) is introduced to cluster services into semantically coherent domains. On top of service domain clustering results by {vKNN}, a probabilistic matching model Domain Router ({DR}) based on Extreme Learning Machine ({ELM}) is developed for decomposing a requirement to relevant domains. Finally, a comprehensive Domain Topic Matching ({DTM}) model is built to mine relevant domain-specific matching patterns to facilitate service recommendation. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset show that {DTM} not only gains significant improvement at precision rate but also enhances the diversity of results.},

As collaborative filtering ({CF}) is an effective recommendation method by capturing latent factors, it has been used for service recommendation as well. However, the majority of current {CF}-based service recommendation approaches predict users' interests through the historical usage data, but not the service description. This makes them suitable for making {QoS}-based recommendation, but not for functionality-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose to use machine learning approaches to recommend web services to users from both historical usage data and service descriptions. Considering the great popularity of Restful services, our approach is applicable to both structured and unstructured service description, i.e., Free text descriptions. We exploit the idea of collaborative topic regression, which combines both probabilistic matrix factorization and probabilistic topic modeling, to form user-related, service-related, and topic related latent factor models and use them to predict user interests. We extracted public web service data and developer invocation history from Programmable Web and conducted a comprehensive experiment study. The result indicates that this approach is effective and outperforms other representative recommendation methods.},

In this paper, we propose a neighborhood regularized matrix factorization method for collaborative Web service {QoS} prediction by properly incorporating both user and Web service neighborhood relationships aiming to improve the accuracy of prediction as well as alleviate the data sparsity issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves more accurate prediction than other well-known methods.},

	title = {Probability Matrix Factorization},
	abstract = {Many existing approaches to collaborative filtering can neither handle very large
datasets nor easily deal with users who have very few ratings. In this paper we
present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization ({PMF}) model which scales linearly
with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the
large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the {PMF}
model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the
model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the {PMF} model that is based on the assumption that users who
have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings.
When the predictions of multiple {PMF} models are linearly combined with the
predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate
of 0.8861, that is nearly 7\% better than the score of Netflix’s own system.},

	abstract = {Web Services are the most famous implementation of service-oriented architectures that has brought some challenging research issues. One of these is the composition, i.e., the capability to recursively construct a composite Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services, which are developed by different organizations and offer diverse functionalities (e.g., ticket purchase, payment), transactional properties (e.g., compensatable or not), and Quality of Service ({QoS}) values (e.g., execution price, success rate). The selection of a Web service, for each activity of the workflow, meeting the user's requirements, is still an important challenge. Indeed, the selection of one Web service among a set of them that fulfill some functionalities is a critical task, generally depending on a combined evaluation of {QoS}. However, the conventional {QoS}-aware composition approaches do not consider the transactional constraints during the composition process. This paper addresses the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and {QoS} characteristics. We propose a selection algorithm that satisfies user's preferences, expressed as weights over {QoS} criteria and as risk levels defining semantically the transactional requirements. Proofs and experimental results are presented.},

	abstract = {In novel collaborative systems, cooperative entities collaborate services to achieve local and global objectives. With the growing pervasiveness of cyber-physical systems, however, such collaboration is hampered by differences in the operations of the cyber and physical objects, and the need for the dynamic formation of collaborative functionality given high-level system goals has become practical. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer automation and management model for cyber-physical systems. This models the dynamic formation of collaborative services pursuing laid-down system goals as an ontology-oriented hierarchical task network. Ontological intelligence provides the semantic technology of this model, and through semantic reasoning, primitive tasks can be dynamically composed from high-level system goals. In dealing with uncertainty, we further propose a novel bridge between hierarchical task networks and Markov logic networks, called the Markov task network. This leverages the efficient inference algorithms of Markov logic networks to reduce both computational and inferential loads in task decomposition. From the results of our experiments, high-precision service composition under uncertainty can be achieved using this approach.},

	abstract = {The low-rank matrix recovery problem consists of reconstructing an unknown low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, possibly corrupted by noise. One of the most popular method in low-rank matrix recovery is based on nuclear-norm minimization, which seeks to simultaneously estimate the most significant singular values of the target low-rank matrix by adding a penalizing term on its nuclear norm. In this paper, we introduce a new method that requires substantially fewer measurements needed for exact matrix recovery compared to nuclear norm minimization. The proposed optimization program utilizes a sparsity promoting regularization in the form of the entropy function of the singular values. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms stage-of-the-art nuclear norm minimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Fourier-domain structured low-rank matrix priors are emerging as powerful alternatives to traditional image recovery methods such as total variation and wavelet regularization. These priors specify that a convolutional structured matrix, i.e., Toeplitz, Hankel, or their multilevel generalizations, built from Fourier data of the image should be low-rank. The main challenge in applying these schemes to large-scale problems is the computational complexity and memory demand resulting from lifting the image data to a large-scale matrix. We introduce a fast and memory-efficient approach called the generic iterative reweighted annihilation filter algorithm that exploits the convolutional structure of the lifted matrix to work in the original unlifted domain, thus considerably reducing the complexity. Our experiments on the recovery of images from undersampled Fourier measurements show that the resulting algorithm is considerably faster than previously proposed algorithms and can accommodate much larger problem sizes than previously studied.},
