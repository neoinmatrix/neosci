Web services have been widely employed for building service-oriented applications in both industry and academia in recent years. The number of publicly available Web services is steadily increasing on the Internet. However, this proliferation makes it hard for a user to select a proper Web service among a large amount of service candidates. An inappropriate service selection may cause many problems (e.g., ill-suited performance) to the resulting applications. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering-based Web service recommender system to help users select services with optimal Quality-of-Service ({QoS}) performance. Our recommender system employs the location information and {QoS} values to cluster users and services, and makes personalized service recommendation for users based on the clustering results. Compared with existing service recommendation methods, our approach achieves considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy. Comprehensive experiments are conducted involving more than 1.5 million {QoS} records of real-world Web services to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Collaborative Filtering ({CF}) is widely employed for making Web service recommendation. {CF}-based Web service recommendation aims to predict missing {QoS} (Quality-of-Service) values of Web services. Although several {CF}-based Web service {QoS} prediction methods have been proposed in recent years, the performance still needs significant improvement. First, existing {QoS} prediction methods seldom consider personalized influence of users and services when measuring the similarity between users and between services. Second, Web service {QoS} factors, such as response time and throughput, usually depends on the locations of Web services and users. However, existing Web service {QoS} prediction methods seldom took this observation into consideration. In this paper, we propose a location-aware personalized {CF} method for Web service recommendation. The proposed method leverages both locations of users and Web services when selecting similar neighbors for the target user or service. The method also includes an enhanced similarity measurement for users and Web services, by taking into account the personalized influence of them. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using a real-world Web service dataset. The experimental results indicate that our approach improves the {QoS} prediction accuracy and computational efficiency significantly, compared to previous {CF}-based methods.},

In {QoS}-based Web service recommendation, predicting missing {QoS} values of services is often required. There have been several methods of Web service recommendation based on collaborative filtering, but seldom have they considered locations of both users and services in predicting {QoS} values of Web services. Actually, locations of users or services do have remarkable impacts on values of {QoS} factors, such as response time, throughput, and reliability. In this paper, we propose a method of location-aware collaborative filtering to recommend Web services to users by incorporating locations of both users and services. Different from existing user-based collaborative filtering for finding similar users for a target user, instead of searching entire set of users, we concentrate on users physically near to the target user. Similarly, we also modify existing service similarity measurement of collaborative filtering by employing service location information. After finding similar users and services, we use the similarity measurement to predict missing {QoS} values based on a hybrid collaborative filtering technique. Web service candidates with the top {QoS} values are recommended to users. To validate our method, we conduct series of large-scale experiments based on a real-world Web service {QoS} dataset.

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems ({CPS}) have received much attention from both academia and industry. An increasing number of functions in {CPS} are provided in the way of services, which gives rise to an urgent task, that is, how to recommend the suitable services in a huge number of available services in {CPS}. In traditional service recommendation, collaborative filtering ({CF}) has been studied in academia, and used in industry. However, there exist several defects that limit the application of {CF}-based methods in {CPS}. One is that under the case of high data sparsity, {CF}-based methods are likely to generate inaccurate prediction results. In this paper, we discover that mining the potential similarity relations among users or services in {CPS} is really helpful to improve the prediction accuracy. Besides, most of traditional {CF}-based methods are only capable of using the service invocation records, but ignore the context information, such as network location, which is a typical context in {CPS}. In this paper, we propose a novel service recommendation method for {CPS}, which utilizes network location as context information and contains three prediction models using random walking. We conduct sufficient experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and verify that the network location is indeed useful in {QoS} prediction.},

Then, by identifying user neighbors on the basis of geographical location, we take the effect of neighbors鈥 experience of Web service invocation into consideration. Specifically, we propose two models based on {PMF}, i.e. \$L-{PMF}\$ and \${WL}-{PMF}\$, which integrate the feature vectors of neighbors into the learning process of latent user feature vectors. Finally, extensive experiments conducted in the real-world dataset demonstrate that our models outperform other well-known approaches consistently.},

To avoid the expensive and costly Web services invocations, this paper proposes an extended Matrix Factorization ({EMF}) framework with relational regularization to make missing {QoS} values prediction. We first elaborate the Matrix Factorization ({MF}) model from a general perspective. To collect the wisdom of crowds precisely, we employ different similarity measurements on user side and service side to identify neighborhood. And then we systematically design two novel relational regularization terms inside a neighborhood. Finally we combine both terms into a unified {MF} framework to predict the missing {QoS} values.

However, the highly sparse {QoS} data complicate the challenges. In the real world, since {QoS} delivery can be significantly affected by some dominant factors in the service environment (e.g., network delay and the location of user or service), Web services which are published by the same provider usually have the similar fundamental network environment. These factors can be leveraged for accurate {QoS} predictions, leading to high-quality service recommendations. In this paper, we expound how Latent Factor Models ({LFM}) can be utilized to predict the unknown {QoS} values. Meanwhile, we take the factors of provider and its country into consideration, which imply the latent physical location and network status information, as the latent neighbor for the set of Web services. Hence, the novel neighbor factor model is built to evaluate the personalized connection quality of latent neighbors for each service user. Then, we propose an integrated model based on {LFM}.

However, most existing approaches ignore the data credibility problem and are thus vulnerable to the unreliable {QoS} data contributed by dishonest users. To address this problem, we propose a trust-aware approach {TAP} for reliable personalized {QoS} prediction. Firstly, we cluster the users and calculate the reputation of users based on the clustering information by a beta reputation system. Secondly, a set of trustworthy similar users is identified according to the calculated user reputation and similarity. Finally, we identify a set of similar services by clustering the services and make prediction for active users by combining the {QoS} data of the trustworthy similar users and similar services.

	abstract = {Web services {QoS} (Quality of Service) prediction in dynamic environment is a critical method to support service selection and service composition. The existing {QoS} prediction methods focus on the user-side {QoS} but not the server-side. However, the prediction accuracy of {QoS} prediction methods for user-side {QoS} are restricted by the subjectivity of user's feedback, while the server-side {QoS} prediction methods could get higher prediction accuracy with relying on objective {QoS} measured value. To this end, we purposed a server-side {QoS} prediction method for Web service dubbed {QoSPAC}. Based on Kalman Filter, {QoSPAC} generates the {QoS} predicted value and uses the {QoS} measured value to calibrate it. Furthermore, {QoSPAC} measures the prediction accuracy, which is also used to calibrate and optimize the prediction period. Experimental results demonstrate that {QoSPAC} can adapt to the noteworthy measurement error, and can significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the conventional technology.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of web services are being invoked by users to create user applications (e.g., mashups). However, over time, a few good services in service systems have become deprecated, i.e., the service is initially available and is invoked by service users, but later becomes unavailable. Therefore, the prediction of service deprecation has become a key issue in creating reliable long-term user applications. Most existing research has overlooked service deprecation in service systems and has failed to consider long-term service reliability when making service recommendations. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting service deprecation, which comprises two components: Service Comprehensive Feature Modeling ({SCFM}) for extracting service features relevant to service deprecation and Deprecated Service Prediction ({DSP}) for building a service deprecation prediction model. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method yields an improved Area-Under-the-Curve ({AUC}) value over existing methods and thus has better accuracy in service deprecation prediction.},

	abstract = {Fast deployment of mobile Internet makes Web services often consumed under a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal model, wherein a specific service client could keep active while its location is changing. Recommending Web services for such clients must be able to predict unknown {QoS} values with the target client's service requesting time and location taken into account, e.g., Performing the prediction via a set of measured multi-dimensional {QoS} data. Most {QoS} prediction methods focus on the {QoS} characteristics for one specific dimension, e.g., Time or location, and do not exploit the structural relationships among the multi-dimensional {QoS} data. This paper proposes an integrated {QoS} prediction approach which unifies the modeling of multi-dimensional {QoS} data via multi-linear-algebra based concepts of tensor and enables efficient service recommendation for Web service based mobile clients via tensor decomposition and reconstruction optimization algorithms. Comparative experimental evaluation results show that the proposed {QoS} prediction approach could result in much better accuracy in recommending Web services than several other representative ones.},

	abstract = {Quality of services ({QoS}) is an important concern in Web service recommendation or selection. Predicting {QoS} values of Web services based on their historical {QoS} records is an effective way to acquire Web service {QoS}, and thus has attracted considerable research interests. Recently, matrix factorization ({MF}), a well-known model-based collaborative filtering ({CF}) technique, has been successfully applied to the Web service {QoS} prediction. It is generally believed that {MF} can significantly outperform traditional memory-based {CF} techniques. However, previous work seldom considered the influence of the underlying network on Web service {QoS} when adopting {MF} for Web service {QoS} prediction. Hence, the prediction performance is not good enough. In this paper, we propose a network-aware Web service {QoS} prediction approach by integrating {MF} with the network map. By employing the network map, network distances between service users can be measured and neighborhoods of users are identified. Then, the traditional {MF} model is revamped by incorporating the constraint term that neighbor users are likely to perceive similar {QoS} of Web services. Experiments conducted on two real-world Web service datasets indicate that our approach outperforms previous {MF} and {CF}-based approaches in prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growth of web services as a major technology for sharing data, computing resources, and programs on the web. With the increasing adoption and presence of web services, design of novel approaches for effective web service recommendation to satisfy users' potential requirements has become of paramount importance. Existing web service recommendation approaches mainly focus on predicting missing {QoS} values of web service candidates which are interesting to a user using collaborative filtering approach, content-based approach, or their hybrid. These recommendation approaches assume that recommended web services are independent to each other, which sometimes may not be true. As a result, many similar or redundant web services may exist in a recommendation list. In this paper, we propose a novel web service recommendation approach incorporating a user's potential {QoS} preferences and diversity feature of user interests on web services. User's interests and {QoS} preferences on web services are first mined by exploring the web service usage history. Then we compute scores of web service candidates by measuring their relevance with historical and potential user interests, and their {QoS} utility. We also construct a web service graph based on the functional similarity between web services. Finally, we present an innovative diversity-aware web service ranking algorithm to rank the web service candidates based on their scores, and diversity degrees derived from the web service graph. Extensive experiments are conducted based on a real world web service dataset, indicating that our proposed web service recommendation approach significantly improves the quality of the recommendation results compared with existing methods.},

	abstract = {Between matrix factorization or Random Walk with Restart ({RWR}), which method works better for recommender systems? Which method handles explicit or implicit feedback data better? Does additional side information help recommen- dation? Recommender systems play an important role in many e-commerce services such as Amazon and Netflix to recommend new items to a user. Among various recommendation strategies, collaborative filtering has shown good performance by using rating patterns of users. Matrix factorization and random walk with restart are the most representative collaborative filtering methods. However, it is still unclear which method provides better recommendation performance despite their extensive utility. In this paper, we provide a comparative study of matrix factorization and {RWR} in recommender systems. We exactly formulate each correspondence of the two methods according to various tasks in recommendation. Especially, we newly devise an {RWR} method using global bias term which corresponds to a matrix factorization method using biases. We describe details of the two methods in various aspects of recommendation quality such as how those methods handle cold-start problem which typ- ically happens in collaborative filtering. We extensively perform experiments over real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of each method in terms of various measures. We observe that matrix factorization performs better with explicit feedback ratings while {RWR} is better with implicit ones. We also observe that exploiting global popularities of items is advantageous in the performance and that side information produces positive synergy with explicit feedback but gives negative effects with implicit one.},

State-of-the-art methods use matrix factorization or collaborative prediction to estimate web service response times and throughput for each user based on partial measurements collected from past invocations. We point out that in reality, both the response times and through-put of web services follow highly skewed distributions. In this case, the conditional mean {QoS} estimates generated by traditional matrix completion approaches can be heavily biased toward a few outliers, leading to poor web service recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose the Quantile Matrix Factorization ({QMF}) technique for web service recommendation by introducing quantile regression into the matrix factorization framework. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm based on Iterative Reweighted Least Squares ({IRLS}) to solve the {QMF} problem involving a non-smooth objective function. We further extend the proposed {QMF} approach to take into account user and service side attributes.

	abstract = {Reliability prediction is an important research problem in software reliability engineering, which has been widely studied in the last decades. However, modelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box services remain an open problem. Software services, such as Web services and Web {APIs}, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the Internet, leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability analysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only on the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g., service workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models become ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by black-box services, in this paper, we propose {CARP}, a context-aware reliability prediction approach that leverages historical usage data from users for reliability prediction. Through context-aware model construction and prediction, {CARP} is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily limits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches. The preliminary evaluation results show that {CARP} can make significant improvement on reliability prediction accuracy, e.g., 41\% for {MAE} and 38\% for {RMSE} when only 5\% of data are available.},

	abstract = {The imprecise quality of service ({QoS}) evaluations from consumers may lead to the inappropriate prediction for the trustworthiness of cloud services in an uncertain cloud environment. The service ranking prediction is a promising idea to overcome this deficiency of values prediction approaches by probing the ordering relations between cloud services concealed in the imprecise evaluations. To address the challenges for trustworthy service selection resulting from fluctuating {QoS}, flexible service pricing and complicated potential risks, this paper proposes a time-aware approach to predict the trustworthiness ranking of cloud services, with the tradeoffs between performance-cost and potential risks in multiple periods. In this approach, the interval neutrosophic set ({INS}) theory is utilized to describe and assess the performance-costs and potential risks of cloud services: (1) the original evaluation data about cloud services are preprocessed into the trustworthiness interval neutrosophic numbers ({INNs}); (2) the new {INS} operators are proposed with the theoretical proofs to calculate the possibility degree and the ranking values of trustworthiness {INNs}, contributing to the identification of the neighboring users based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient ({KRCC}). The problem of time-aware trustworthiness ranking prediction is formulated as a multi-criterion decision-making ({MCDM}) problem of creating a ranked services list using {INS}, and an improved {ELECTRE} method is developed to solve it. The proposed approach is verified by experiments based on an appropriate baseline for comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a better prediction quality than the existing approach. The results also show that our approach works effectively in the risk-sensitive and performance-cost-sensitive application scenarios and prevent the malignant price competition launched by low-quality services.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation -- collaborative filtering -- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named {NCF}, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. {NCF} is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge {NCF} modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed {NCF} framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Stochastic optimization algorithms have many desirable features for large-scale machine learning, and accordingly have been the focus of renewed and intensive study in the last several years (e.g., see the papers [2], [5], [14] and references therein). The empirical efficiency of these methods is backed with strong theoretical guarantees, providing sharp bounds on their convergence rates. These convergence rates are known to depend on the structure of the underlying objective function, with faster rates being possible for objective functions that are smooth and/or (strongly) convex, or optima that have desirable features such as sparsity. More precisely, for an objective function that is strongly convex, stochastic gradient descent enjoys a convergence rate ranging from O(1/T ), when features vectors are extremely sparse, to O(d/T ) when feature vectors are dense [10], [6]. A complementary type of condition is that of sparsity, either exact or approximate, in the optimal solution. Sparse models have proven useful in many application areas (see the overview papers [4], [9], [3] and references therein for further background), and many optimization-based statistical procedures seek to exploit such sparsity via ℓ1-regularization. A significant feature of optimization algorithms for sparse problems is their mild logarithmic scaling with the problem dimension [11], [12], [5], [14]. More precisely, itis known [11], [12] that when the optimal solution θ has at most s non-zero entries, appropriate versions of the stochastic mirror descent algorithm ',/ converge at a rate O(s (log d)/T ). Srebro et al. [13] exploit the smoothness of many common loss functions; in application to sparse linear regression, their analysis yields improved rates ',/ of the form O(η (s log d)/T), where η is the noise variance. While the Vlog d scaling of the dimension makes these methods attractive in high dimensions, the scaling with respe- t to the number V of iterations is relatively slow-namely, O(1/ T ) versus O(1/T) for strongly convex problems.The algorithm proposed in this paper aims to use both strong convexity and sparsity. We show that the algorithm has convergence rate O((s log d)/T) for a strongly convex problem with an s-sparse optimum in d dimensions. Moreover, this rate is unimprovable up to constant factors, meaning that no algorithm can converge at a substantially faster rate. The method builds off recent work on multi-step methods for strongly convex problems [7], [8], but involves some new ingredients that are essential to obtain optimal rates for statistical problems with sparse optima. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions regarding the convergence rate of the algorithm, and demonstrate its performance in comparison to other methods: regularized dual averaging [14] and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. We refer the reader to the full report [1] for more details.},

Firstly, we use the context information and the number of co-rated items to define users’ similarity. Then, motivated by the theory of six degrees of space, the friend familiarity is derived by graph-based method. Thus the proposed methods are further enhanced by considering users’ context in the recommendation phase. Finally, a set of simulations are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. The results show that the friend familiarity and user similarity can effectively improve the recommendation performance, and the friend familiarity contributes more than the user similarity.},

Previous work usually exploits the collaborative filtering techniques for Web service recommendation, but suffers from the data sparsity problem that leads to inaccurate results. Our analysis on a real-world Quality of Service ({QoS}) dataset shows that there is a hidden correlation among users and services. We define such hidden correlation with an asymmetric matrix (namely asymmetric correlation), in which each entry presents the hidden correlation between a user pair or between a service pair. The goal of this work is to employ such asymmetric correlation among users and services to alleviate the data sparsity problem and further enhance the prediction accuracy in service recommendation. Specifically, we propose an asymmetric correlation regularized matrix factorization ({MF}) framework, in which asymmetric correlation and asymmetric correlation propagation have been naturally integrated.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of {SOA} (Service Oriented Architecture), an increasing number of Web services have been published on the Internet. How to recommend suitable Web services to users becomes a challenging problem. Existing Web services recommendation approaches based on collaborative filtering mainly focus on {QoS} (Quality of Service) prediction. Recommending services based on users' ratings on services are seldom reported since such explicit feedback data is difficult to collect. In this paper, we report a dataset of implicit feedback on real-world Web services, which consist of more than 280,000 user-service interaction records, 65,000 service users and 15,000 Web services or mashups. In addition, time is becoming an increasingly important factor in recommenders since time effects influence users' preferences to a large extent. Based on the collected dataset, we propose a time-aware service recommendation approach. Temporal information is sufficiently considered in our approach, where three time effects are analyzed and modeled including user bias shifting, Web service bias shifting, and user preference shifting. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms seven existing collaborative filtering approaches on the prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Due to the large and increasing number of web services, it is very helpful to provide a proactive feed on what is available to users, i.e., Recommending web services. As collaborative filtering ({CF}) is an effective recommendation method by capturing latent factors, it has been used for service recommendation as well. However, the majority of current {CF}-based service recommendation approaches predict users' interests through the historical usage data, but not the service description. This makes them suitable for making {QoS}-based recommendation, but not for functionality-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose to use machine learning approaches to recommend web services to users from both historical usage data and service descriptions. Considering the great popularity of Restful services, our approach is applicable to both structured and unstructured service description, i.e., Free text descriptions. We exploit the idea of collaborative topic regression, which combines both probabilistic matrix factorization and probabilistic topic modeling, to form user-related, service-related, and topic related latent factor models and use them to predict user interests. We extracted public web service data and developer invocation history from Programmable Web and conducted a comprehensive experiment study. The result indicates that this approach is effective and outperforms other representative recommendation methods.},

Quality-of-Service ({QoS}), the fundamental aspect of web service has thus attracted numerous attention in industry and academia. The study on sufficient {QoS} data keeps advancing the state in Service-Oriented Computing ({SOC}) area. To collect a large amount of resource in practice, {QoS} prediction applications are designed and built. Nevertheless, how to generate accurate results in high productivity is still a main challenge to existing frameworks. In this paper, we propose {LoNMF}, a Local Neighborhood Matrix Factorization application that incorporates domain knowledge in modern Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) technique to tackle this challenge. {LoNMF} first proposes a two-level selection mechanism that can identify a set of highly relevant local neighbors for target user. And then, it integrates the geographical information to build up an extended Matrix Factorization ({MF}) approach for personalized {QoS} prediction. Finally, it iteratively generates results by utilizing hints from previous round computations, a gradient boosting strategy that directly accelerates solving process. Experimental evidence on large-scale real-world {QoS} data shows that {LoNMF} is scalable, and consistently outperforming other state-of-the-art applications in prediction accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {With the incessant growth of Web services on the Internet, designing effective Web service recommendation technologies based on Quality of Service ({QoS}) is becoming more and more important. Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering has been widely used for Web service recommendation, in which similarity measurement and {QoS} prediction are two key steps. However, traditional similarity models and {QoS} prediction methods rarely consider the influence of time information, which is an important factor affecting the {QoS} of Web services. Furthermore, traditional similarity models fail to capture the actual relationships between users or services due to data sparsity. These shortcomings seriously devalue the performance of neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering. In order to make high-quality Web service recommendation, we propose a novel time-aware approach, which integrates time information into both the similarity measurement and the final {QoS} prediction. Additionally, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, a hybrid personalized random walk algorithm is employed to infer more indirect user similarities and service similarities. Finally, we conduct series of experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approaches.},

It is natural and reasonable to assume that the {QoS} Web services perform and the choices users make are significantly influenced by their neighbors, thus it will be beneficial to incorporate this new source of information in {QoS} prediction. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood regularized matrix factorization method for collaborative Web service {QoS} prediction by properly incorporating both user and Web service neighborhood relationships aiming to improve the accuracy of prediction as well as alleviate the data sparsity issue.

	abstract = {Quality-of-Service ({QoS})-aware web service composition is of great importance to assemble individual services into a composite one meeting functional and nonfunctional requirements. Given a large number of candidate services, automatic composition is essential so as to derive a composite service efficiently. Most existing methods return one solution that is optimal in some given criteria. This is somewhat rigid in terms of flexibility. In case some component service in the optimal composition becomes unavailable, the composition algorithm has to run again to find another optimal solution. Also, in a lot of circumstances users prefer multiple alternatives over a single one. Therefore, providing top- k service compositions according to their {QoS} is becoming more desirable. On another aspect, from the perspective of computation efficiency, due to the explosion of the searching space, single-threaded methods are usually not capable of handling a large number of candidate services. This paper tackles these two issues together, i.e., large-scale, {QoS}-based services composition yielding top- k solutions. The composition algorithm is based on the combination of backtrack search and depth-first search, which can be executed in a parallel way. Experiments are carried out based on the datasets provided by the {WS}-Challenge competition 2009 and China Web Service 2011. The results show that our approach can not only find the same optimal solution as the winning systems from these competitions, but also provide alternative solutions together with the optimal {QoS}.},

Therefore, recommending services based on user queries becomes a necessity. For modeling the queries and services' descriptions, many recent studies are based on {LDA} (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). However, some previous empirical works indicate that {LDA} model doesn't gain high accuracy in generating latent presentation which is subject to the restrictive assumption of the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution. In this paper, we propose a Time-aware Collaborative Poisson Factorization ({TCPF}) to tackle the problem. {TCPF} takes Poisson Factorization as the foundation to model mashup queries and service descriptions separately, and incorporate them with the historical usage data together using collective matrix factorization. Experiments on the real-world {ProgrammableWeb} dataset show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Time-aware collaborative domain regression) by 7.7\% in terms of mean average precision, and costs much less time on the sparse, massive and long-tailed data set.},

	abstract = {如今，机器学习正在互联网上下掀起热潮，而Python则是非常适合开发机器学习系统的一门优秀语言。作为动态语言，它支持快速探索和实验，并且针对Python的机器学习算法库的数量也与日俱增。本书最大的特色，就是结合实例分析教会读者如何通过机器学习解决实际问题。
本书将向读者展示如何从原始数据中发现模式，首先从Python与机器学习的关系讲起，再介绍一些库，然后就开始基于数据集进行比较正式的项目开发了，涉及建模、推荐及改进，以及声音与图像处理。通过流行的开源库，我们可以掌握如何高效处理文本、图片和声音。同时，读者也能掌握如何评估、比较和选择适用的机器学习技术。
举几个例子，我们会介绍怎么把{StackOverflow的回答按质量高低进行分类}，怎么知道某个音乐文件是爵士风格，还是重金属摇滚风格。另外，本书还涵盖了主题建模、购物习性分析及云计算等高级内容。总之，通过学习本书，读者可以掌握构建自己所需系统的各方面知识，并且学以致用，解决自己面临的现实问题。
读者只要具有一定的Python编程经验，能够自己安装和使用开源库，就足够了，即使对机器学习一点了解都没有也没关系。本书不会讲机器学习算法背后的数学。},

	abstract = {Many existing approaches to collaborative filtering can neither handle very large
datasets nor easily deal with users who have very few ratings. In this paper we
present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization ({PMF}) model which scales linearly
with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the
large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the {PMF}
model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the
model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the {PMF} model that is based on the assumption that users who
have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings.
When the predictions of multiple {PMF} models are linearly combined with the
predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate
of 0.8861, that is nearly 7\% better than the score of Netflix’s own system.},

	abstract = {Web Services are the most famous implementation of service-oriented architectures that has brought some challenging research issues. One of these is the composition, i.e., the capability to recursively construct a composite Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services, which are developed by different organizations and offer diverse functionalities (e.g., ticket purchase, payment), transactional properties (e.g., compensatable or not), and Quality of Service ({QoS}) values (e.g., execution price, success rate). The selection of a Web service, for each activity of the workflow, meeting the user's requirements, is still an important challenge. Indeed, the selection of one Web service among a set of them that fulfill some functionalities is a critical task, generally depending on a combined evaluation of {QoS}. However, the conventional {QoS}-aware composition approaches do not consider the transactional constraints during the composition process. This paper addresses the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and {QoS} characteristics. We propose a selection algorithm that satisfies user's preferences, expressed as weights over {QoS} criteria and as risk levels defining semantically the transactional requirements. Proofs and experimental results are presented.},

	abstract = {In novel collaborative systems, cooperative entities collaborate services to achieve local and global objectives. With the growing pervasiveness of cyber-physical systems, however, such collaboration is hampered by differences in the operations of the cyber and physical objects, and the need for the dynamic formation of collaborative functionality given high-level system goals has become practical. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer automation and management model for cyber-physical systems. This models the dynamic formation of collaborative services pursuing laid-down system goals as an ontology-oriented hierarchical task network. Ontological intelligence provides the semantic technology of this model, and through semantic reasoning, primitive tasks can be dynamically composed from high-level system goals. In dealing with uncertainty, we further propose a novel bridge between hierarchical task networks and Markov logic networks, called the Markov task network. This leverages the efficient inference algorithms of Markov logic networks to reduce both computational and inferential loads in task decomposition. From the results of our experiments, high-precision service composition under uncertainty can be achieved using this approach.},
